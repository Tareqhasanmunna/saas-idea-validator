==============================================================================

INPUT:
  - Best SL Model (LightGBM at 81.4% accuracy)
  - Training dataset with labels

OUTPUT:
  - Trained policy network (rl_policy_best.pt)
  - Visualizations for thesis:
    * Training history (rewards, accuracy, losses)
    * Convergence analysis (moving averages)
    * RL vs Baseline comparison
    * Per-class metrics
    * Confusion matrix
  - JSON summary report with exact metrics
  - Expected improvement: +0.5% to +2% accuracy

KEY PARAMETERS (Edit in rl_train_main.py)
==============================================================================

episodes: 100                    # Number of training episodes
reward_scheme: 'balanced'        # 'accuracy', 'f1', or 'balanced'
gamma: 0.99                      # Discount factor (long-term focus)
device: 'cpu'                    # 'cpu' or 'cuda' (GPU)
test_split: 0.2                  # Test set fraction

==============================================================================
TRAINING ALGORITHM: ACTOR-CRITIC
==============================================================================

Architecture:
  - Policy Network (Actor): Learns what actions to take
  - Value Network (Critic): Estimates value of states
  - PyTorch implementation with neural networks

Learning:
  - Actor Loss: -log(π(a|s)) × A(s,a)  [policy gradient]
  - Critic Loss: (target - V(s))²       [value estimation]
  - Combined loss optimized with Adam optimizer

Expected Convergence:
  - Fast learning: Episodes 1-20
  - Stable improvements: Episodes 20-50
  - Fine-tuning: Episodes 50-100

REWARD SCHEMES
==============================================================================

ACCURACY (Simple):
  correct → +1.0
  incorrect → -0.5

F1 (Class-aware):
  correct + minority class → +2.0
  correct + majority class → +1.0
  incorrect + minority class → -2.0
  incorrect + majority class → -0.5

BALANCED (Current Default):
  Each class has weight {0: 2.0, 1: 1.0, 2: 1.0}
  Emphasizes minority class performance

==============================================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS
==============================================================================

Baseline (SL Model - LightGBM):
  ✓ Accuracy: 81.4%
  ✓ F1 Score: 81.5%
  ✓ ROC-AUC: 94.0%

After RL Training (100 episodes):
  ✓ Expected Accuracy: 82-83% (+0.5% to +2%)
  ✓ Expected F1: 82-84% (+1% to +3%)
  ✓ Expected Stability: Better across classes
  ✓ Training time: 5-15 minutes (CPU), <1 minute (GPU)

Your Current Accuracy (94%):
  If this is the actual test set accuracy, RL may have:
  ✓ Marginal improvements: +0.2% to +0.5%
  ✓ Better class balance
  ✓ More stable predictions

==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION
==============================================================================

Change reward scheme:
    config['reward_scheme'] = 'f1'

Train for longer:
    config['episodes'] = 200

Use GPU:
    config['device'] = 'cuda'

Modify network architecture:
    Edit PolicyNetwork class in rl_agent.py
    Change hidden_dim or add layers

Custom reward function:
    Edit _compute_reward() in rl_environment.py

==============================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
==============================================================================

No module torch:
  → pip install torch

GPU out of memory:
  → Change device to 'cpu'

Training too slow:
  → Use GPU (requires CUDA)
  → Or reduce episodes

No improvement shown:
  → Increase episodes
  → Try different reward scheme
  → Check if baseline already optimal

==============================================================================
NEXT PHASE: LIVE FEEDBACK (When Ready)
==============================================================================

After RL shows consistent improvements:

1. Deploy trained policy to production
2. Collect real user feedback
3. Update reward function based on outcomes
4. Re-train RL with live feedback
5. Continuous monitoring and adaptation
