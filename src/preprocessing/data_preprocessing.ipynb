         "I built a SaaS marketplace listing aggregator with no code I'm looking to acquire a micro SaaS and was finding it tedious jumping between Flippa, Acquire and the others. So I decided to scratch my own itch and knock out a [simple tool](https://saasifieds.io) that brings all the listings together in one place with simple but powerful searching and filtering. You can now easily see the latest listings across both marketplaces (and more to follow) sorted by date added, along with the key metrics (MRR, ARR, multiples, age, price) for each. I even run this info through AI to generate a 1-5 star rating and investor summary for each opportunity which is pretty decent overall (though I might tweak the prompt a bit). Not sure where I'm going with this yet but just wanted to build something interesting and useful and see what I could achieve with no code. Feedback, ideas and suggestions welcome:\n\n[https://saasifieds.io](https://saasifieds.io)",

Anyone have tips on tools or approaches that make it simple to build production ready apps fast, like with built in payments and auth, no extra setups?\n\nAlso, whats the best way to make designs that actually look good and not generic? And for non coders, how do you test scalability before launch? Id love any advice from folks who've shipped fully functional apps this way. Thanks!",

My Slack status is green but I haven't had a real conversation in weeks. \n\n\"Quick sync?\" = 5 minute Zoom where everyone's camera is off and we're all multitasking \n\n\"Team bonding?\" = Awkward virtual happy hour where we stare at each other through screens \n\n\"Water cooler chat?\" = Dead Slack channels with occasional GIF reactions \n\nI used to complain about open offices. About commutes. About having to wear pants. I'd give anything for that now. \n\nI miss: \n\n* Spontaneous conversations that led to solutions \n* Lunch with coworkers where we talked about nothing \n* The energy of people around me Someone noticing when I'm struggling \n* Eye contact \n* Feeling like part of something\n\nInstead I'm just a Slack avatar. A GitHub username. A Zoom rectangle with my name at the bottom.\n\n My friends tell me to \"just go to a coffee shop\" but it's not the same. Everyone there is also alone, pretending to be productive, avoiding eye contact. \n\nI joined a coworking space. Spent $400/month to sit near other people who also don't talk to each other.\n\n My partner keeps asking why I'm in a bad mood all the time. I don't know how to explain that I'm just... depleted. That Slack messages aren't the same as human interaction. That I'm starting to forget how to have normal conversations.\n\n Companies saved money on office space and called it \"flexibility.\" What they actually did was isolate us all in our little boxes and now we're too far in to admit it's not working.\n\n I don't have a solution.

         "Building a SaaS MVP in 2025? Here's how to make exactly $0 by December: * Skip OAuth. Make users create accounts with passwords they'll forget in 3 seconds. Bonus points if you require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, a symbol, their firstborn's name, and a poem about entrepreneurship.\n* Offer a 60-day free trial. Nothing screams \"I don't believe in this\" like desperately begging people to maybe possibly pay you in two months. If they remember you exist.\n* Spend 18 months building in your basement. Don't talk to users, don't validate anything, just code. Or even better, use AI to code for you. Then act shocked when you launch to crickets.\n* Never self-promote. Marketing is gross and salesy. Only mention your product if someone asks three times.\n* Keep emailing the unsubscribers. They're just playing hard to get.\n* Don't use your own product. You built it, you know how it works. Spend your time adding features literally nobody asked for instead.\n* New signups are everything. Who cares if your existing users are ghosting you?¬†\n* Your MVP needs every feature you can think of. AI chatbot that nobody will use ‚Äì hell yeah. That one feature your co-founder's aunt mentioned is also obviously critical.\n* Pivot every 2 weeks. If it doesn't work immediately, the idea sucks.¬†\n* Your landing page needs parallax scrolling, a video background, 47 features listed in 8pt font, and absolutely zero clarity on what the hell you actually do.\n* Avoid users at all costs. They just complain and have opinions. Better to stare at Google Analytics and make up stories about what the numbers mean.\n* Price at $9/month because everyone else does. Definitely don't think about value or anything dumb like that.\n\nAlso, most important: Take advice from LinkedIn gurus who've never shipped anything except motivational carousels.\n\nBut hey, at least your product will look really polished when nobody uses it.\n\nAnything you‚Äôd add?",

         "How I Reduced Setup Time for New SaaS Projects by 70% Starting new SaaS projects often meant spending countless hours on repetitive setup tasks such as configuring authentication, setting up databases, integrating payments, and ensuring SEO readiness. This process was not only time-consuming but also mentally exhausting.\n\nTo streamline this, I developed a Nuxt 4 boilerplate that automates these foundational tasks. This tool has allowed me to focus more on building features and less on repetitive setup.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* Pre-configured authentication and authorization\n* Integrated Stripe payments\n* Seamless database setup with Drizzle ORM and Neon DB\n* Tailwind CSS for responsive design\n* SEO optimization and PWA support\n\nBy using this boilerplate, I estimate a 70% reduction in setup time for new projects.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring this tool, here it is: [ShipAhead](https://shipahe.ad/)",

There, you find a lot more real free resources, support communities, and people who really share their methods without a second thought.\n\nIn short, I learned that the best way to succeed is to experiment yourself, to test, to fail, and to learn by doing rather than blindly following those who call themselves ‚Äúexperts‚Äù.",

         "Lessons from building a lightweight SaaS for freelancers (focus, scope, and simplicity) Over the last few weeks, I‚Äôve been building a small SaaS focused on one clear goal: helping freelancers manage client work more smoothly.\n\nWhile working on it, I realized how easy it is to over complicate a product early on. I started with a big list of ideas invoicing, payments, scheduling but halfway through, I noticed it was turning into a heavy app instead of solving the core pain point.\n\nThat led me to strip everything back and focus only on three things:\n\n* Client communication\n* Feedback tracking\n* Simple project updates\n\nOnce I narrowed it down, development moved faster and the product actually started to feel useful.\n\nI‚Äôm curious how other founders here handle this balance:  \nHow do you decide when to stop adding features and ship the first version?\n\nWould love to hear how you‚Äôve approached MVP scope in your SaaS journey.\n\nThanks,  \nAli",

         "Marketing & growth strategies from a five-figure MRR founder We recently interviewed the founder of a company doing 5-figures in MRR which was a white-label social media API powering 250K+ accounts currently that's been in business for 1.5 years. Both founders are still working full-time jobs, but they‚Äôve grown to consistent five-figure MRR in under two years.\n\nHere are some of the learnings from the interview:\n\n**1. Validate with users who are paying**\n\nThey never ran a landing page test or built a waitlist. Instead, they solved their own problem (posting across multiple accounts) when they realized their competitor product was charging thousands of dollars. They had friends in the e-commerce space ask for access. Those friends paid even when the product was rough. That signal was enough validation to continue to invest in this project.\n\n**2. Cold emailing**\n\nThey built lists through Apollo and SEO tools, & sent thousands of emails. The format of the email was kept simple: a short intro, proof they were a legit company, and a 3-touch follow up. No long copy led to conversations. The conversion rate is currently at: \\~2% from email sent to paying customer.\n\n**3. Reddit**\n\nThe team spends time daily in relevant threads answering questions, giving advice, and only mentioning the product when it makes sense. They approach reddit with a value based approach, when they deliver value first and plug the product second. He mentioned it was easy to spot threads that feel disingenuous and to avoid that if possible.\n\n**4. Live chat for pre-sale**\n\nThey run a live chat platform on the site and most buyers actually initiate the chat first, asking for details about features. That quick back-and-forth often flips them into paying customers once they realize that their needs are met.\n\nIt also provides them with the ability to handle objections, highlight their quick response rates & offer deals or free trials to reduce friction.\n\n**5. Free month to remove migration risk**\n\nInstead of asking people to pay right away, they offered one free month of the Pro plan. It gave time for new customers to connect accounts and test end to end without worrying about long setup processes. By the end of the month, most converted to a paid plan.\n\nHope this helps when going to market!",

         "Was I wrong how I positioned my SAAS to the audience? Guys, I really need a feedback.\nI have launched my product month ago. There are around 50 registered users, they sometimes login to their accounts and I can see they do using some features inside.\n\nThe product is crino.io\n\nA platform which combines investor contacts and their past deals. I have some functionality to filter the investors, to see their last deals, their co-partners, I have built CRM so users can add investors in pipelines they want to track the progress in.\n\nI tried to explain the main features as much as I could on the homepage. The whole website is built in React, node js in server. Fast database, I tested everything I could to test, reallyüòÅ\n\nSo, I am just wondering if everything is okay how I am actually positioning the product.\n\nIf you could just review the website, maybe use it a bit, go page to page and check the pricing etc. anything you could give me as a feedback - is a very appreciated!!!\n\nA bit more input data for you:\n14 Sep - 14 Oct, 2025\n* all data doesn‚Äôt include my localhost traffic and some bots they parse me time to time; so it‚Äôs clear.\n\n- I have 2,012 users so far\n- 42 users used at least one filter on public page (/find-investors)\n- in average they use at least one filter 3 times per user\n- 54 users have registered on the platform (2,68%)\n- 1 user started checkout\n- 0 users completed checkout\n\nGoogle organic:\n- 68.3k total impressions on Google (according to Search Console)\n- 576 clicks\n- Average CTR is 0.8%\n\nI have tried some paid Google ads, just for test. Nothing special here I could share, really.",

         "We‚Äôre building an AI control center that costs 1/4 of ChatGPT Business I‚Äôm Paul, co-founder at keinsaas. We‚Äôve been building automation for companies for 3 years.\n\nEvery client asked the same thing: **‚ÄúWhy do I need 15 different AI tools?‚Äù**\n\nChatGPT for chat. Claude for writing. Zapier for automation. Google Drive for files. Notion for knowledge. Slack for communication.  \nThey‚Äôre all disconnected. You‚Äôre constantly switching tabs, copying data, and repeating context.\n\nSo we built **Navigator** ‚Äî one interface that connects everything.\n\n**What makes it different:**\n\n* **Multi-LLM routing:** Best model is picked automatically (Claude for research, GPT for speed, Gemini for vision...). Failover if one is down. EU/self-hosted options for privacy.\n* **Tool integration:** 500+ via MCP (Google Workspace, Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, Slack, Zapier, n8n, Make). Search across files, execute tasks across multiple apps...\n* **Real workflows:** e.g. ‚ÄúFind companies that hired a CFO last month and add them to my CRM.‚Äù Navigator decides the model + tools + workflows.\n* **Trigger automations from n8n or Zapier with @:** Hook automations from any platform to the chat and trigger when you need with additional context in your prompt. \n\n**Pricing:**\n\n* ChatGPT Business**:** ‚Ç¨34/user/month on monthly billing. A 10-person team = ‚Ç¨4,080/year.\n* Navigator: Pay-as-you-go. ‚Ç¨15 ‚âà 800 standard searches or 500 workflows. 10er team: ‚Ç¨1000‚Äì1500/month.\n* No per-seat pricing. If 3 people use it heavily, you only pay for those 3.\n\n**Why we productized it:**  \nWe kept rebuilding the same solution for clients. Everyone wanted AI that connects to their tools, not isolated chat windows.\n\n**Who this is for:**\n\n* Teams juggling multiple AI tools\n* Founders who want automation without learning complex tools\n* Companies needing AI tied to actual workflows\n* Anyone preferring usage-based pricing over subscriptions\n\nWe‚Äôre opening beta next month. First 200 users get ‚Ç¨15 credits to test \n\n‚û°Ô∏è [**You can sign up for access here.**](https://beta.keinsaas.com/)\n\nWould love feedback from other SaaS founders:\n\n* How does the pricing model land with you?\n* Which integrations/features would make this most useful?\n* What should we skip/scrap?\n* What‚Äôs your biggest frustration with current AI tools?",
