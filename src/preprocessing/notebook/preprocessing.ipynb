You tell it how you feel (e.g., tired, stressed, sad)\n2. It instantly gives a concise, uplifting quote\n\nExample:  \n*Mood: tired* ‚Üí *‚ÄúEven small steps forward are victories.‚Äù*\n\nThis is just a **quick MVP** to test the idea, and I‚Äôd love your feedback:\n\n* Does this feel useful?\n* Would you use it daily?\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to try it, **leave a comment or DM me** and I‚Äôll send you the link. This helps me see how many people are genuinely interested before building the full version with more features.\n\nThanks for checking it out! üôè",

It also needs more funding to reach the right audience, and I'm stretched too thin to give it the attention it deserves.\n\nThis product has serious potential in a huge market, but it needs someone who can focus on it and push it forward‚Äîsomething I can't do right now.\n\n**What's included:**  \n‚úÖ Fully working SaaS with clean code  \n‚úÖ AI chatbot that integrates with websites  \n‚úÖ Complete docs and handover support  \n‚úÖ Ready to scale with proper marketing\n\nIf you're looking to acquire something with real potential and you've got the time or budget to market it properly, let's talk.

         "Got rejected by an accelerator. It turned out to be the best thing that happened to me building my SaaS for mentorship. I invested a lot of time and energy in investigating what is my true potential. I have seen countless youtube videos, talked to peers, friends, and strangers to find out what can I do or not do to find the one thing that will change my life for better. The answer has always been different because each of us has their own perspectives and life experiences which mould our decisions and circumstances. Then I realized, I have to do my own thing and I have always been keen to do business but not any business, only big business, disruptive business, which could forever become my legacy.\n\nThat thought alone became a nightmare-ish demand that I put on myself and it naturally led to utter disappointments. I was publicly embarrassed and couldn't even face my friends and family. However, those were crude lessons because of my own inclinations. This taught me what to do and what not to do in a startup. However, to build the startup you got to have at least the idea, money, and execution and not specifically in that order. All my ideas failed, I had no money saved, and my execution led to utter embarrassment. Also, it happened twice, lol.\n\nIt's not that the ideas were bad, I just needed structured guidance and investment. So, for the third try of being an entrepreneur, I started applying in startup accelerators, incubators, and business coaching programs. They all rejected me. This was the best thing that happened because it led me to pivot in the right direction and it felt like my calling as something that will lead me to my true potential. Now I help those rejected founders like me to launch and grow their startups but without the gatekeeping.",

You tell it how you feel (e.g., tired, stressed, sad)\n2. It instantly gives a concise, uplifting quote\n\nExample:  \n*Mood: tired* ‚Üí *‚ÄúEven small steps forward are victories.‚Äù*\n\nThis is just a **quick MVP** to test the idea, and I‚Äôd love your feedback:\n\n* Does this feel useful?\n* Would you use it daily?\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to try it, **leave a comment or DM me** and I‚Äôll send you the link. This helps me see how many people are genuinely interested before building the full version with more features.\n\nThanks for checking it out! üôè",

         "[SaaS Exit] Just listed my product on Acquire‚Äîhere's the story Hey folks üëã\n\nAfter months of building and iterating, I've listed my SaaS on Acquire.\n\n[https://app.acquire.com/startup/DTU6gHsL0ygDl0gXqRSJKVcI3DN2/pMD2bbx6xidIq4uMop0o](https://app.acquire.com/startup/DTU6gHsL0ygDl0gXqRSJKVcI3DN2/pMD2bbx6xidIq4uMop0o)\n\nIt's a chatbot platform I built for real estate agents‚Äîhelps them capture and qualify leads automatically, even when they're busy or offline.\n\nNo VC backing, no crazy burn rate‚Äîjust a solid product that solves a real problem.\n\n**Why I'm selling (the honest truth):**  \nI'm running a digital agency full-time, and between client work and everything else, I just don't have the bandwidth to market this properly. It also needs more funding to reach the right audience, and I'm stretched too thin to give it the attention it deserves.\n\nThis product has serious potential in a huge market, but it needs someone who can focus on it and push it forward‚Äîsomething I can't do right now.\n\n**What's included:**  \n‚úÖ Fully working SaaS with clean code  \n‚úÖ AI chatbot that integrates with websites  \n‚úÖ Complete docs and handover support  \n‚úÖ Ready to scale with proper marketing\n\nIf you're looking to acquire something with real potential and you've got the time or budget to market it properly, let's talk. Happy to answer any questions or share what I've learned along the way.\n\nDM me or check the listing on Acquire.\n\nCheers!",

         "What If Your CRM Could Think Like a Salesperson? Every CRM today still needs you to tell it what‚Äôs happening log calls, update deals, follow up manually.  \nBut what if your CRM actually thought like a salesperson predicting the next move, drafting the perfect follow-up, even identifying deals at risk before you notice them?\n\nWith AI-native CRMs now emerging, this future isn‚Äôt far.\n\n**Would you trust a CRM that thinks and acts autonomously? Or do you believe human intuition will always be irreplaceable?**\n\nWhere do you see the balance between automation and human touch in sales?",

         "Got rejected by an accelerator. It turned out to be the best thing that happened to me building my SaaS for mentorship. I invested a lot of time and energy in investigating what is my true potential. I have seen countless youtube videos, talked to peers, friends, and strangers to find out what can I do or not do to find the one thing that will change my life for better. The answer has always been different because each of us has their own perspectives and life experiences which mould our decisions and circumstances. Then I realized, I have to do my own thing and I have always been keen to do business but not any business, only big business, disruptive business, which could forever become my legacy.\n\nThat thought alone became a nightmare-ish demand that I put on myself and it naturally led to utter disappointments. I was publicly embarrassed and couldn't even face my friends and family. However, those were crude lessons because of my own inclinations. This taught me what to do and what not to do in a startup. However, to build the startup you got to have at least the idea, money, and execution and not specifically in that order. All my ideas failed, I had no money saved, and my execution led to utter embarrassment. Also, it happened twice, lol.\n\nIt's not that the ideas were bad, I just needed structured guidance and investment. So, for the third try of being an entrepreneur, I started applying in startup accelerators, incubators, and business coaching programs. They all rejected me. This was the best thing that happened because it led me to pivot in the right direction and it felt like my calling as something that will lead me to my true potential. Now I help those rejected founders like me to launch and grow their startups but without the gatekeeping.",

It instantly gives a concise, uplifting quote\n\nExample:  \n*Mood: tired* ‚Üí *‚ÄúEven small steps forward are victories.‚Äù*\n\nThis is just a **quick MVP** to test the idea, and I‚Äôd love your feedback:\n\n* Does this feel useful?\n* Would you use it daily?\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to try it, **leave a comment or DM me** and I‚Äôll send you the link. This helps me see how many people are genuinely interested before building the full version with more features.\n\nThanks for checking it out! üôè"

It turned out to be the best thing that happened to me building my SaaS for mentorship. I invested a lot of time and energy in investigating what is my true potential. I have seen countless youtube videos, talked to peers, friends, and strangers to find out what can I do or not do to find the one thing that will change my life for better. The answer has always been different because each of us has their own perspectives and life experiences which mould our decisions and circumstances. Then I realized, I have to do my own thing and I have always been keen to do business but not any business, only big business, disruptive business, which could forever become my legacy.\n\nThat thought alone became a nightmare-ish demand that I put on myself and it naturally led to utter disappointments. I was publicly embarrassed and couldn't even face my friends and family. However, those were crude lessons because of my own inclinations. This taught me what to do and what not to do in a startup. However, to build the startup you got to have at least the idea, money, and execution and not specifically in that order. All my ideas failed, I had no money saved, and my execution led to utter embarrassment. Also, it happened twice, lol.\n\nIt's not that the ideas were bad, I just needed structured guidance and investment. So, for the third try of being an entrepreneur, I started applying in startup accelerators, incubators, and business coaching programs. They all rejected me. This was the best thing that happened because it led me to pivot in the right direction and it felt like my calling as something that will lead me to my true potential. Now I help those rejected founders like me to launch and grow their startups but without the gatekeeping."

I have seen countless youtube videos, talked to peers, friends, and strangers to find out what can I do or not do to find the one thing that will change my life for better. The answer has always been different because each of us has their own perspectives and life experiences which mould our decisions and circumstances. Then I realized, I have to do my own thing and I have always been keen to do business but not any business, only big business, disruptive business, which could forever become my legacy.\n\nThat thought alone became a nightmare-ish demand that I put on myself and it naturally led to utter disappointments. I was publicly embarrassed and couldn't even face my friends and family. However, those were crude lessons because of my own inclinations. This taught me what to do and what not to do in a startup. However, to build the startup you got to have at least the idea, money, and execution and not specifically in that order. All my ideas failed, I had no money saved, and my execution led to utter embarrassment.

It turned out to be the best thing that happened to me building my SaaS for mentorship. I invested a lot of time and energy in investigating what is my true potential. I have seen countless youtube videos, talked to peers, friends, and strangers to find out what can I do or not do to find the one thing that will change my life for better. The answer has always been different because each of us has their own perspectives and life experiences which mould our decisions and circumstances. Then I realized, I have to do my own thing and I have always been keen to do business but not any business, only big business, disruptive business, which could forever become my legacy.\n\nThat thought alone became a nightmare-ish demand that I put on myself and it naturally led to utter disappointments. I was publicly embarrassed and couldn't even face my friends and family. However, those were crude lessons because of my own inclinations. This taught me what to do and what not to do in a startup. However, to build the startup you got to have at least the idea, money, and execution and not specifically in that order. All my ideas failed, I had no money saved, and my execution led to utter embarrassment. Also, it happened twice, lol.\n\nIt's not that the ideas were bad, I just needed structured guidance and investment. So, for the third try of being an entrepreneur, I started applying in startup accelerators, incubators, and business coaching programs. They all rejected me. This was the best thing that happened because it led me to pivot in the right direction and it felt like my calling as something that will lead me to my true potential. Now I help those rejected founders like me to launch and grow their startups but without the gatekeeping.",

I have seen countless youtube videos, talked to peers, friends, and strangers to find out what can I do or not do to find the one thing that will change my life for better. The answer has always been different because each of us has their own perspectives and life experiences which mould our decisions and circumstances. Then I realized, I have to do my own thing and I have always been keen to do business but not any business, only big business, disruptive business, which could forever become my legacy.\n\nThat thought alone became a nightmare-ish demand that I put on myself and it naturally led to utter disappointments. I was publicly embarrassed and couldn't even face my friends and family. However, those were crude lessons because of my own inclinations. This taught me what to do and what not to do in a startup. However, to build the startup you got to have at least the idea, money, and execution and not specifically in that order. All my ideas failed, I had no money saved, and my execution led to utter embarrassment. Also, it happened twice, lol.\n\nIt's not that the ideas were bad, I just needed structured guidance and investment.
