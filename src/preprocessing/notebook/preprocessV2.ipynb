         "Nobody is talking about life after launching, but they should Everyone glorifies launch day. The Product Hunt screenshot. The \"We're live!\" tweet. The 48-hour dopamine hit.  \n  \nBut nobody talks about Day 3.  \n  \nWhen the launch high wears off and you realize you still need to:  \n\\- Actually keep users engaged  \n\\- Fix bugs they're finding in real-time  \n\\- Answer support tickets at 2 AM  \n\\- Figure out why 80% of signups never come back  \n\\- Deal with that one angry user who wants a refund  \n\\- Still do marketing (because launch traffic dies FAST)  \n  \nLaunch day is like a wedding. Everyone shows up, celebrates, takes photos.  \n  \nBut after launch? That's the marriage. The real work. The daily grind. The \"oh shit, now I have to actually run this thing\" reality.  \n  \nHere's what I wasn't prepared for:  \n  \n\\- The silence is deafening. After all the launch buzz, it gets QUIET. Like eerily quiet. Your Slack is dead, your analytics flatline, and you're wondering if anyone actually cares.  \n  \n\\- Users expect you to be Amazon now. Doesn't matter if you launched 3 days ago. They want 24/7 support, instant responses, and features that took Notion 5 years to build.  \n  \n\\- Imposter syndrome hits different. Pre-launch, you're excited. Post-launch, you're watching real people use your thing and thinking \"holy shit, what if this is actually garbage?\"  \n  \n\\- The feature requests are WILD. Someone will ask for a feature that would take 6 months to build and act like it's a bug that it doesn't exist.  \n  \n\\- You're now in customer support forever. That code you wrote? You now have to explain it to people who've never used software before. At scale.  \n  \nThe truth? Launching is the easy part, It's a one-time event with a clear deadline and a dopamine reward at the end.  \n  \nLife after launching is the REAL test. It's:  \n\\- Showing up every day when nobody's watching  \n\\- Iterating when you're exhausted  \n\\- Supporting users when you'd rather be building  \n\\- Staying motivated when growth is slow  \n\\- Keeping your mental health intact  \n  \nIf you're about to launch: ENJOY IT. Celebrate the hell out of it. But also mentally prepare for the emotional whiplash of the week after.  \n  \nTo everyone in the post-launch grind: you're not alone. This is the part that actually matters. The repetitive, exhausting work of building something real.  \n  \nKeep going.",

         "I watched a $2M Series A startup almost die because nobody could figure out how to use their product. Three months ago I got a panicked call from a founder I'd worked with before.\n\nHis team had just closed their Series A. They'd spent 18 months building this beautiful AI analytics platform. The product actually worked. The demos were slick. They had 12 enterprise pilots lined up.\n\nThen the pilots started.\n\nWithin two weeks, 9 out of 12 companies couldn't get past onboarding. Support tickets were flooding in. The same questions over and over. \"How do I connect my data source?\" \"What does this error mean?\" \"Where's the export button?\"\n\nThe founder was losing his mind. They were burning $180k/month and their close rate was tanking.\n\nHere's the thing that killed me:¬†the product wasn't broken. The documentation was.\n\nThey had:\n\n* A README file from 6 months ago\n* Random Notion pages the devs wrote for themselves\n* A \"help center\" that was just their old landing page copy\n* Zero onboarding guides\n* API docs that assumed you already knew how everything worked\n\nTheir head of sales was literally screen recording himself using the product and sending Loom videos to every new customer. Manually. One by one.\n\nI've seen this exact pattern four times now in the past two years.\n\nThe mistakes that keep repeating:\n\n1. Treating docs as an afterthought Everyone obsesses over the UI. Nobody thinks about what happens when a user gets stuck at 11pm and support is offline.\n2. Letting engineers write for users Your devs are brilliant. But they can't explain things to someone who doesn't live in your codebase. They use internal terminology. They skip steps that seem \"obvious.\"\n3. Assuming people will \"figure it out\" No. They won't. They'll churn. I've watched it happen in real time.\n4. Waiting until after launch By the time you realize docs are a problem, you're already bleeding customers and your team is drowning in support tickets.\n\nWhat actually happened with that startup:\n\nI spent 11 weeks embedded with them. Interviewed their support team. Sat in on user calls. Watched session recordings of people getting stuck.\n\nThen rebuilt everything:\n\n* Proper onboarding flow with screenshots\n* Troubleshooting guides for every common error\n* API docs that actually explained the \"why\" not just the \"what\"\n* Video walkthroughs for complex workflows\n\nThree months later their support ticket volume dropped 60%. Their trial-to-paid conversion went from 8% to 23%. Sales stopped having to do manual demos for basic features.\n\nThe founder told me last week they probably wouldn't have survived without fixing this.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is, your product can be incredible. Your code can be clean. Your UI can be beautiful. But if people can't figure out how to use it, none of that matters.\n\nDocumentation isn't marketing fluff. It's not something you do \"when you have time.\"\n\nIt's the difference between a user who gets value in 10 minutes vs a user who rage-quits and never comes back.\n\nFor anyone building right now:\n\nIf you're pre-launch, build your docs alongside your product. Not after.\n\nIf you're post-launch and seeing high churn or support volume, look at your docs first before you blame the product.\n\nAnd if your engineers are writing your user-facing documentation... maybe rethink that.",

         "Nobody is talking about life after launching, but they should Everyone glorifies launch day. The Product Hunt screenshot. The \"We're live!\" tweet. The 48-hour dopamine hit.  \n  \nBut nobody talks about Day 3.  \n  \nWhen the launch high wears off and you realize you still need to:  \n\\- Actually keep users engaged  \n\\- Fix bugs they're finding in real-time  \n\\- Answer support tickets at 2 AM  \n\\- Figure out why 80% of signups never come back  \n\\- Deal with that one angry user who wants a refund  \n\\- Still do marketing (because launch traffic dies FAST)  \n  \nLaunch day is like a wedding. Everyone shows up, celebrates, takes photos.  \n  \nBut after launch? That's the marriage. The real work. The daily grind. The \"oh shit, now I have to actually run this thing\" reality.  \n  \nHere's what I wasn't prepared for:  \n  \n\\- The silence is deafening. After all the launch buzz, it gets QUIET. Like eerily quiet. Your Slack is dead, your analytics flatline, and you're wondering if anyone actually cares.  \n  \n\\- Users expect you to be Amazon now. Doesn't matter if you launched 3 days ago. They want 24/7 support, instant responses, and features that took Notion 5 years to build.  \n  \n\\- Imposter syndrome hits different. Pre-launch, you're excited. Post-launch, you're watching real people use your thing and thinking \"holy shit, what if this is actually garbage?\"  \n  \n\\- The feature requests are WILD. Someone will ask for a feature that would take 6 months to build and act like it's a bug that it doesn't exist.  \n  \n\\- You're now in customer support forever. That code you wrote? You now have to explain it to people who've never used software before. At scale.  \n  \nThe truth? Launching is the easy part, It's a one-time event with a clear deadline and a dopamine reward at the end.  \n  \nLife after launching is the REAL test. It's:  \n\\- Showing up every day when nobody's watching  \n\\- Iterating when you're exhausted  \n\\- Supporting users when you'd rather be building  \n\\- Staying motivated when growth is slow  \n\\- Keeping your mental health intact  \n  \nIf you're about to launch: ENJOY IT. Celebrate the hell out of it. But also mentally prepare for the emotional whiplash of the week after.  \n  \nTo everyone in the post-launch grind: you're not alone. This is the part that actually matters. The repetitive, exhausting work of building something real.  \n  \nKeep going.",

         "I watched a $2M Series A startup almost die because nobody could figure out how to use their product. Three months ago I got a panicked call from a founder I'd worked with before.\n\nHis team had just closed their Series A. They'd spent 18 months building this beautiful AI analytics platform. The product actually worked. The demos were slick. They had 12 enterprise pilots lined up.\n\nThen the pilots started.\n\nWithin two weeks, 9 out of 12 companies couldn't get past onboarding. Support tickets were flooding in. The same questions over and over. \"How do I connect my data source?\" \"What does this error mean?\" \"Where's the export button?\"\n\nThe founder was losing his mind. They were burning $180k/month and their close rate was tanking.\n\nHere's the thing that killed me:¬†the product wasn't broken. The documentation was.\n\nThey had:\n\n* A README file from 6 months ago\n* Random Notion pages the devs wrote for themselves\n* A \"help center\" that was just their old landing page copy\n* Zero onboarding guides\n* API docs that assumed you already knew how everything worked\n\nTheir head of sales was literally screen recording himself using the product and sending Loom videos to every new customer. Manually. One by one.\n\nI've seen this exact pattern four times now in the past two years.\n\nThe mistakes that keep repeating:\n\n1. Treating docs as an afterthought Everyone obsesses over the UI. Nobody thinks about what happens when a user gets stuck at 11pm and support is offline.\n2. Letting engineers write for users Your devs are brilliant. But they can't explain things to someone who doesn't live in your codebase. They use internal terminology. They skip steps that seem \"obvious.\"\n3. Assuming people will \"figure it out\" No. They won't. They'll churn. I've watched it happen in real time.\n4. Waiting until after launch By the time you realize docs are a problem, you're already bleeding customers and your team is drowning in support tickets.\n\nWhat actually happened with that startup:\n\nI spent 11 weeks embedded with them. Interviewed their support team. Sat in on user calls. Watched session recordings of people getting stuck.\n\nThen rebuilt everything:\n\n* Proper onboarding flow with screenshots\n* Troubleshooting guides for every common error\n* API docs that actually explained the \"why\" not just the \"what\"\n* Video walkthroughs for complex workflows\n\nThree months later their support ticket volume dropped 60%. Their trial-to-paid conversion went from 8% to 23%. Sales stopped having to do manual demos for basic features.\n\nThe founder told me last week they probably wouldn't have survived without fixing this.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is, your product can be incredible. Your code can be clean. Your UI can be beautiful. But if people can't figure out how to use it, none of that matters.\n\nDocumentation isn't marketing fluff. It's not something you do \"when you have time.\"\n\nIt's the difference between a user who gets value in 10 minutes vs a user who rage-quits and never comes back.\n\nFor anyone building right now:\n\nIf you're pre-launch, build your docs alongside your product.

         "Nobody is talking about life after launching, but they should Everyone glorifies launch day. The Product Hunt screenshot. The \"We're live!\" tweet. The 48-hour dopamine hit.  \n  \nBut nobody talks about Day 3.  \n  \nWhen the launch high wears off and you realize you still need to:  \n\\- Actually keep users engaged  \n\\- Fix bugs they're finding in real-time  \n\\- Answer support tickets at 2 AM  \n\\- Figure out why 80% of signups never come back  \n\\- Deal with that one angry user who wants a refund  \n\\- Still do marketing (because launch traffic dies FAST)  \n  \nLaunch day is like a wedding. Everyone shows up, celebrates, takes photos.  \n  \nBut after launch? That's the marriage. The real work. The daily grind. The \"oh shit, now I have to actually run this thing\" reality.  \n  \nHere's what I wasn't prepared for:  \n  \n\\- The silence is deafening. After all the launch buzz, it gets QUIET. Like eerily quiet. Your Slack is dead, your analytics flatline, and you're wondering if anyone actually cares.  \n  \n\\- Users expect you to be Amazon now. Doesn't matter if you launched 3 days ago. They want 24/7 support, instant responses, and features that took Notion 5 years to build.  \n  \n\\- Imposter syndrome hits different. Pre-launch, you're excited. Post-launch, you're watching real people use your thing and thinking \"holy shit, what if this is actually garbage?\"  \n  \n\\- The feature requests are WILD. Someone will ask for a feature that would take 6 months to build and act like it's a bug that it doesn't exist.  \n  \n\\- You're now in customer support forever. That code you wrote? You now have to explain it to people who've never used software before. At scale.  \n  \nThe truth? Launching is the easy part, It's a one-time event with a clear deadline and a dopamine reward at the end.  \n  \nLife after launching is the REAL test. It's:  \n\\- Showing up every day when nobody's watching  \n\\- Iterating when you're exhausted  \n\\- Supporting users when you'd rather be building  \n\\- Staying motivated when growth is slow  \n\\- Keeping your mental health intact  \n  \nIf you're about to launch: ENJOY IT. Celebrate the hell out of it. But also mentally prepare for the emotional whiplash of the week after.  \n  \nTo everyone in the post-launch grind: you're not alone. This is the part that actually matters. The repetitive, exhausting work of building something real.  \n  \nKeep going.",

Three months ago I got a panicked call from a founder I'd worked with before.\n\nHis team had just closed their Series A. They'd spent 18 months building this beautiful AI analytics platform. The product actually worked. The demos were slick. They had 12 enterprise pilots lined up.\n\nThen the pilots started.\n\nWithin two weeks, 9 out of 12 companies couldn't get past onboarding. Support tickets were flooding in. The same questions over and over. \"How do I connect my data source?\" \"What does this error mean?\" \"Where's the export button?\"\n\nThe founder was losing his mind. They were burning $180k/month and their close rate was tanking.\n\nHere's the thing that killed me:¬†the product wasn't broken. The documentation was.\n\nThey had:\n\n* A README file from 6 months ago\n* Random Notion pages the devs wrote for themselves\n* A \"help center\" that was just their old landing page copy\n* Zero onboarding guides\n* API docs that assumed you already knew how everything worked\n\nTheir head of sales was literally screen recording himself using the product and sending Loom videos to every new customer. Manually. One by one.\n\nI've seen this exact pattern four times now in the past two years.\n\nThe mistakes that keep repeating:\n\n1. Treating docs as an afterthought Everyone obsesses over the UI. Nobody thinks about what happens when a user gets stuck at 11pm and support is offline.\n2. Letting engineers write for users Your devs are brilliant. But they can't explain things to someone who doesn't live in your codebase. They use internal terminology. They skip steps that seem \"obvious.\"\n3. Assuming people will \"figure it out\" No. They won't. They'll churn. I've watched it happen in real time.\n4. Waiting until after launch By the time you realize docs are a problem, you're already bleeding customers and your team is drowning in support tickets.\n\nWhat actually happened with that startup:\n\nI spent 11 weeks embedded with them. Interviewed their support team. Sat in on user calls. Watched session recordings of people getting stuck.\n\nThen rebuilt everything:\n\n* Proper onboarding flow with screenshots\n* Troubleshooting guides for every common error\n* API docs that actually explained the \"why\" not just the \"what\"\n* Video walkthroughs for complex workflows\n\nThree months later their support ticket volume dropped 60%. Their trial-to-paid conversion went from 8% to 23%. Sales stopped having to do manual demos for basic features.\n\nThe founder told me last week they probably wouldn't have survived without fixing this.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is, your product can be incredible. Your code can be clean. Your UI can be beautiful. But if people can't figure out how to use it, none of that matters.\n\nDocumentation isn't marketing fluff. It's not something you do \"when you have time.\"\n\nIt's the difference between a user who gets value in 10 minutes vs a user who rage-quits and never comes back.\n\nFor anyone building right now:\n\nIf you're pre-launch, build your docs alongside your product.

Manually. One by one.\n\nI've seen this exact pattern four times now in the past two years.\n\nThe mistakes that keep repeating:\n\n1. Treating docs as an afterthought Everyone obsesses over the UI. Nobody thinks about what happens when a user gets stuck at 11pm and support is offline.\n2. Letting engineers write for users Your devs are brilliant.

They want 24/7 support, instant responses, and features that took Notion 5 years to build.  \n  \n\\- Imposter syndrome hits different. Pre-launch, you're excited. Post-launch, you're watching real people use your thing and thinking \"holy shit, what if this is actually garbage?\"  \n  \n\\- The feature requests are WILD. Someone will ask for a feature that would take 6 months to build and act like it's a bug that it doesn't exist.  \n  \n\\- You're now in customer support forever. That code you wrote? You now have to explain it to people who've never used software before. At scale.  \n  \nThe truth? Launching is the easy part, It's a one-time event with a clear deadline and a dopamine reward at the end.  \n  \nLife after launching is the REAL test. It's:  \n\\- Showing up every day when nobody's watching  \n\\- Iterating when you're exhausted  \n\\- Supporting users when you'd rather be building  \n\\- Staying motivated when growth is slow  \n\\- Keeping your mental health intact  \n  \nIf you're about to launch: ENJOY IT. Celebrate the hell out of it. But also mentally prepare for the emotional whiplash of the week after.  \n  \nTo everyone in the post-launch grind: you're not alone.

         "I watched a $2M Series A startup almost die because nobody could figure out how to use their product. Three months ago I got a panicked call from a founder I'd worked with before.\n\nHis team had just closed their Series A. They'd spent 18 months building this beautiful AI analytics platform. The product actually worked. The demos were slick. They had 12 enterprise pilots lined up.\n\nThen the pilots started.\n\nWithin two weeks, 9 out of 12 companies couldn't get past onboarding. Support tickets were flooding in. The same questions over and over. \"How do I connect my data source?\" \"What does this error mean?\" \"Where's the export button?\"\n\nThe founder was losing his mind. They were burning $180k/month and their close rate was tanking.\n\nHere's the thing that killed me:¬†the product wasn't broken. The documentation was.\n\nThey had:\n\n* A README file from 6 months ago\n* Random Notion pages the devs wrote for themselves\n* A \"help center\" that was just their old landing page copy\n* Zero onboarding guides\n* API docs that assumed you already knew how everything worked\n\nTheir head of sales was literally screen recording himself using the product and sending Loom videos to every new customer. Manually. One by one.\n\nI've seen this exact pattern four times now in the past two years.\n\nThe mistakes that keep repeating:\n\n1. Treating docs as an afterthought Everyone obsesses over the UI. Nobody thinks about what happens when a user gets stuck at 11pm and support is offline.\n2. Letting engineers write for users Your devs are brilliant. But they can't explain things to someone who doesn't live in your codebase. They use internal terminology. They skip steps that seem \"obvious.\"\n3. Assuming people will \"figure it out\" No. They won't. They'll churn. I've watched it happen in real time.\n4. Waiting until after launch By the time you realize docs are a problem, you're already bleeding customers and your team is drowning in support tickets.\n\nWhat actually happened with that startup:\n\nI spent 11 weeks embedded with them. Interviewed their support team. Sat in on user calls. Watched session recordings of people getting stuck.\n\nThen rebuilt everything:\n\n* Proper onboarding flow with screenshots\n* Troubleshooting guides for every common error\n* API docs that actually explained the \"why\" not just the \"what\"\n* Video walkthroughs for complex workflows\n\nThree months later their support ticket volume dropped 60%. Their trial-to-paid conversion went from 8% to 23%. Sales stopped having to do manual demos for basic features.\n\nThe founder told me last week they probably wouldn't have survived without fixing this.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is, your product can be incredible. Your code can be clean. Your UI can be beautiful. But if people can't figure out how to use it, none of that matters.\n\nDocumentation isn't marketing fluff. It's not something you do \"when you have time.\"\n\nIt's the difference between a user who gets value in 10 minutes vs a user who rage-quits and never comes back.\n\nFor anyone building right now:\n\nIf you're pre-launch, build your docs alongside your product. Not after.\n\nIf you're post-launch and seeing high churn or support volume, look at your docs first before you blame the product.\n\nAnd if your engineers are writing your user-facing documentation... maybe rethink that.",

         "I watched a $2M Series A startup almost die because nobody could figure out how to use their product. Three months ago I got a panicked call from a founder I'd worked with before.\n\nHis team had just closed their Series A. They'd spent 18 months building this beautiful AI analytics platform. The product actually worked. The demos were slick. They had 12 enterprise pilots lined up.\n\nThen the pilots started.\n\nWithin two weeks, 9 out of 12 companies couldn't get past onboarding. Support tickets were flooding in. The same questions over and over. \"How do I connect my data source?\" \"What does this error mean?\" \"Where's the export button?\"\n\nThe founder was losing his mind. They were burning $180k/month and their close rate was tanking.\n\nHere's the thing that killed me:¬†the product wasn't broken. The documentation was.\n\nThey had:\n\n* A README file from 6 months ago\n* Random Notion pages the devs wrote for themselves\n* A \"help center\" that was just their old landing page copy\n* Zero onboarding guides\n* API docs that assumed you already knew how everything worked\n\nTheir head of sales was literally screen recording himself using the product and sending Loom videos to every new customer. Manually. One by one.\n\nI've seen this exact pattern four times now in the past two years.\n\nThe mistakes that keep repeating:\n\n1. Treating docs as an afterthought Everyone obsesses over the UI. Nobody thinks about what happens when a user gets stuck at 11pm and support is offline.\n2. Letting engineers write for users Your devs are brilliant. But they can't explain things to someone who doesn't live in your codebase. They use internal terminology. They skip steps that seem \"obvious.\"\n3. Assuming people will \"figure it out\" No. They won't. They'll churn. I've watched it happen in real time.\n4. Waiting until after launch By the time you realize docs are a problem, you're already bleeding customers and your team is drowning in support tickets.\n\nWhat actually happened with that startup:\n\nI spent 11 weeks embedded with them. Interviewed their support team. Sat in on user calls. Watched session recordings of people getting stuck.\n\nThen rebuilt everything:\n\n* Proper onboarding flow with screenshots\n* Troubleshooting guides for every common error\n* API docs that actually explained the \"why\" not just the \"what\"\n* Video walkthroughs for complex workflows\n\nThree months later their support ticket volume dropped 60%. Their trial-to-paid conversion went from 8% to 23%. Sales stopped having to do manual demos for basic features.\n\nThe founder told me last week they probably wouldn't have survived without fixing this.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is, your product can be incredible. Your code can be clean. Your UI can be beautiful. But if people can't figure out how to use it, none of that matters.\n\nDocumentation isn't marketing fluff. It's not something you do \"when you have time.\"\n\nIt's the difference between a user who gets value in 10 minutes vs a user who rage-quits and never comes back.\n\nFor anyone building right now:\n\nIf you're pre-launch, build your docs alongside your product. Not after.\n\nIf you're post-launch and seeing high churn or support volume, look at your docs first before you blame the product.\n\nAnd if your engineers are writing your user-facing documentation... maybe rethink that.",

         "I watched a $2M Series A startup almost die because nobody could figure out how to use their product.",
         "I watched a $2M Series A startup almost die because nobody could figure out how to use their product. Three months ago I got a panicked call from a founder I'd worked with before.\n\nHis team had just closed their Series A. They'd spent 18 months building this beautiful AI analytics platform. The product actually worked. The demos were slick. They had 12 enterprise pilots lined up.\n\nThen the pilots started.\n\nWithin two weeks, 9 out of 12 companies couldn't get past onboarding. Support tickets were flooding in. The same questions over and over. \"How do I connect my data source?\" \"What does this error mean?\" \"Where's the export button?\"\n\nThe founder was losing his mind. They were burning $180k/month and their close rate was tanking.\n\nHere's the thing that killed me:¬†the product wasn't broken. The documentation was.\n\nThey had:\n\n* A README file from 6 months ago\n* Random Notion pages the devs wrote for themselves\n* A \"help center\" that was just their old landing page copy\n* Zero onboarding guides\n* API docs that assumed you already knew how everything worked\n\nTheir head of sales was literally screen recording himself using the product and sending Loom videos to every new customer. Manually. One by one.\n\nI've seen this exact pattern four times now in the past two years.\n\nThe mistakes that keep repeating:\n\n1. Treating docs as an afterthought Everyone obsesses over the UI. Nobody thinks about what happens when a user gets stuck at 11pm and support is offline.\n2. Letting engineers write for users Your devs are brilliant. But they can't explain things to someone who doesn't live in your codebase. They use internal terminology. They skip steps that seem \"obvious.\"\n3. Assuming people will \"figure it out\" No. They won't. They'll churn. I've watched it happen in real time.\n4. Waiting until after launch By the time you realize docs are a problem, you're already bleeding customers and your team is drowning in support tickets.\n\nWhat actually happened with that startup:\n\nI spent 11 weeks embedded with them. Interviewed their support team. Sat in on user calls. Watched session recordings of people getting stuck.\n\nThen rebuilt everything:\n\n* Proper onboarding flow with screenshots\n* Troubleshooting guides for every common error\n* API docs that actually explained the \"why\" not just the \"what\"\n* Video walkthroughs for complex workflows\n\nThree months later their support ticket volume dropped 60%. Their trial-to-paid conversion went from 8% to 23%.

         "I watched a $2M Series A startup almost die because nobody could figure out how to use their product. Three months ago I got a panicked call from a founder I'd worked with before.\n\nHis team had just closed their Series A. They'd spent 18 months building this beautiful AI analytics platform. The product actually worked. The demos were slick. They had 12 enterprise pilots lined up.\n\nThen the pilots started.\n\nWithin two weeks, 9 out of 12 companies couldn't get past onboarding. Support tickets were flooding in. The same questions over and over. \"How do I connect my data source?\" \"What does this error mean?\" \"Where's the export button?\"\n\nThe founder was losing his mind. They were burning $180k/month and their close rate was tanking.\n\nHere's the thing that killed me:¬†the product wasn't broken. The documentation was.\n\nThey had:\n\n* A README file from 6 months ago\n* Random Notion pages the devs wrote for themselves\n* A \"help center\" that was just their old landing page copy\n* Zero onboarding guides\n* API docs that assumed you already knew how everything worked\n\nTheir head of sales was literally screen recording himself using the product and sending Loom videos to every new customer. Manually. One by one.\n\nI've seen this exact pattern four times now in the past two years.\n\nThe mistakes that keep repeating:\n\n1. Treating docs as an afterthought Everyone obsesses over the UI. Nobody thinks about what happens when a user gets stuck at 11pm and support is offline.\n2. Letting engineers write for users Your devs are brilliant. But they can't explain things to someone who doesn't live in your codebase. They use internal terminology. They skip steps that seem \"obvious.\"\n3. Assuming people will \"figure it out\" No. They won't. They'll churn. I've watched it happen in real time.\n4. Waiting until after launch By the time you realize docs are a problem, you're already bleeding customers and your team is drowning in support tickets.\n\nWhat actually happened with that startup:\n\nI spent 11 weeks embedded with them. Interviewed their support team. Sat in on user calls. Watched session recordings of people getting stuck.\n\nThen rebuilt everything:\n\n* Proper onboarding flow with screenshots\n* Troubleshooting guides for every common error\n* API docs that actually explained the \"why\" not just the \"what\"\n* Video walkthroughs for complex workflows\n\nThree months later their support ticket volume dropped 60%.
