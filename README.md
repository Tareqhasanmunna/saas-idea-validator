# SaaS Idea Validation System

## Overview

This project automatically collects SaaS-related posts from Reddit and assigns a validation score and label (`good`, `neutral`, `bad`) for each post. The system considers post sentiment, comment sentiment, upvotes, and recency of posts and comments to generate the validation score. The dataset generated can be used for supervised learning and later integrated with a reinforcement learning system.
